      Deadrop is dedicated to keeping your communications private.  As a first iteration, you will have the capability
      to post large messages of any text completely secure and encrypted.  Only a person who has the link with the
      encryption key will be able to read the message which is encrypted and decrypted on the userâ€™s computer so the
      server never sees the encryption key or unencrypted text.  See our tutorial to get started or just create a new
      drop below.  although no method is completely secure, there are inherent risk to javascript encryption that is
      addressed in our blog.
